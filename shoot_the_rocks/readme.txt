WASD/up down left right moves the spaceship
Spacebar charges the laser, there is no visual feedback for a charged up laser, but if the player taps it once, it won't work. Instead they have to hold it down for a few seconds and then release for laser.
Once the player shoots a rock, it gives out five or six coins which the spaceship should collect for gaining score. Score is displayed on the top.
